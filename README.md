An analysis of the relationship between Universal Healthcare Index and other health-related variables.

Universal Healthcare (UHC) Index is an indicator reported on a 0 to 100 scale that represents a country's ability to achieve universal health coverage including financial risk protection and access to quality healthcare services and essential, affordable medicines. I examined the relationship between UHC Index and suicide rates, infant mortality rates, and life expectancy variables. A correlation matrix and multiple simple linear regression models were built. The data was downloaded, merged, cleaned, analyzed, and visualized in RStudio. Separately, a RMarkdown file was created to export a summary PDF of the project.
