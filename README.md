# Multinational-Healthcare-Analysis
An analysis of the relationship between Universal Healthcare Index and other health-related variables.

Universal Healthcare (UHC) Index is an indicator reported on a 0 to 100 scale that represents a country's ability to achieve universal health coverage including financial risk protection and access to quality healthcare services and essential, affordable medicines. I examined the relationship between UHC Index and suicide rates, infant mortality rates, and life expectancy variables. A correlation matrix and multiple simple linear regression models were built. The data was downloaded, merged, cleaned, analyzed, and visualized in RStudio. Separately, a RMarkdown file was created to export a summary PDF of the project.

It is important to understand that some of the models have problems with the core assumptions in this analysis (specifically the linear regression model that examines the relationship between suicide rates and UHC Index). I am not endorsing any intervention based on the above findings. I'm still a beginner when it comes to statistics, so once I learn more complex skills, perhaps I can use different analyses to address these relationships.
